# Sine Qua Non
**A Webpack boilerplate engineered for simple and performant static websites.**

I developed this boilerplate primarily for myself but thought it might be useful for others. The pretentious Latin name means **_without which, not_** which encapsulates the aspiration to provide all the necessities of modern JS website development.

_Corrections, suggestions, pull requests all very much welcome._

### Key features
üì¶ **Framework agnostic**  

üîÉ **Live-reload development server**

üíÖ **SCSS-compilation and directory structure pre-established**
